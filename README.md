# Login System

A simple and secure login system built using HTML, CSS, and JavaScript (or server-side language if applicable). This project includes basic user authentication features where users can input their credentials, and the system validates them.

## Features

- User login with username and password fields
- Basic form validation for empty fields and password requirements
- Custom error messages for invalid credentials
- Easy to extend for back-end integration (e.g., with Node.js, PHP, or any server-side language)
- Optional: User registration (if implemented)
